/*!
 TWTJSONSchemaASTNodes model a valid JSON schema, as defined by http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#, or a building block of
 one (e.g., TWTJSONSchemaKeyValuePairASTNode). Nodes modeling valid schemas can represent either the entire schema (see
 TWTJSONSchemaTopLevelASTNode) or nested schemas, e.g., self.andNodes represent the schemas that are the value of "allOf". This
 is an abstract class that defines common properties and the interface for accepting a TWTJSONSchemaASTProcessor.
