/*!
 TWTBlockValidators validate objects using a validation block. They are primarily useful when validation logic
 is easier to express in code than by composing one or more validators, but is too unique to warrant creating
 a TWTValidator subclass.
 
 Block validators are immutable objects. As such, sending -copy or -copyWithZone: to a block validator will
 simply return the validator itself.
